## Purpose
The primary purpose for this project is a complete re-design of the Louisville Pipe Band website. As of the time of this writing, the current site is located at [www.louisvillepipeband.org]. The current site was designed many years ago and received little, if any, updates. My goal is to redesign the site so it can effectively be viewed on mobile devices, leveraging current practices and standards. This site will also be the capstone project for the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development class.

## About the Project
As a current office-holding member of the Louisville Pipe Band, I was inspired to redesign the site to improve the "first impressions" for a visitor to our site. The site is not very mobile-friendly, and mobile devices have become so ubiquitous that our current site felt clunky and outdated whenever an audience member visited our site immediately after a public performance. 

The initial commit occured on June 12th, 2017. Navigation through the site should be fairly straightforward.
