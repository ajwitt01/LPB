        <h1>Where We Are</h1>
        <p>Currently led by Ted Palmer, the band's primary goal is to foster the understanding and appreciation of Celtic music through performances, competitions, and instruction. The Louisville Pipe Band has also been designated as the official pipe band of the state of <a href="http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/Statrev/ACTS2000/0048.pdf">Kentucky</a>, having established itself as Kentucky's pre-eminent piping and drumming group.</p>
        <h1>Where We Came From</h1>
        <p>The LPB can trace its roots to the mid-1970's, when Jeffersontown High School and Floyd Central High School used the Great Highland Bagpipes in their band programs. At this time, several members of the Jeffersontown High School band made an effort to contact other pipers in the community: Robert Caudill, Skip Cleavinger, David James and Rob Modys. Rehearsals began at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, and Billy Wallace was the band's first Drum Sergeant. The band had no matching gear, but did manage to present several regional performances before dissolving after the departure of key members to attend college. Shortly afterward, Bill Wallace, a member of the Kosair band, assembled some of his more promising students into the Pegasus Pipe Band. With the inclusion of weekend members from the earlier group, the band grew under PM Charlie Marlatt's direction. During this period, the band began to purchase uniforms, other matching materials, and began to compete against other regional pipe bands. PM Marlatt was a founder of the Highland Games in Carrollton, Kentucky and under his leadership the band was host to the first incarnation of that event. Dr. Andy Henry then served briefly as interim PM before Robert Caudill (a Jeffersontown H.S. alumnus who had played in the band's earliest versions) returned from college to rebuild the group once again. From 1984 - 2005, PM Caudill organized the band around an educational format. The band's name was changed to the Louisville Pipe Band and a training program was instituted offering free instruction. Pat Benningfield led the band from 1992 - 1995 and again in 2007 - 2009 and emphasized competition success and an elevated standard of play.

        <h1>Even Further Back...</h1>
        <p>The band proudly wears the Ancient Henderson tartan (see pattern below) for its uniform in recognition of the historical relationship between Daniel Boone and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henderson_(jurist)">Col. Richard Henderson</a> in the late eighteenth century, which was crucial in the exploration and development of Kentucky. Clan Henderson assisted with the initial purchase of kilts in September 1994 and continues to kindly provide periodic financial support.</p>
